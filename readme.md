# In this repo we create a `bash` script.

In this `bash` script we ask the user for the name for **Resource Group** and **VM**
then we create the same. 

Also we `ssh` into that vm 

## To run this script just type 
```bash
vm.sh
```
then The script will start running 
and asks for the name of VM & resource group

*This `script` creates resources in the uscentral region*

to change the location, Just modify the `-l` flag 
in appropriate places.
eg: ` -l westindia `

### Thank You hope you like it !
